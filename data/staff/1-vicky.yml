bio: >-
  I am a wife and mother of two boys. I graduated from Seneca College in 2015
  where I obtained my Diploma in Early Childhood Education. I have over 10 years of
  experience working with children up to age 12 and loved every moment of it. I
  decided to become an educator because I believe that children are our future and 
  it's out duty to raise our children to lead healthy, successful and independent lives.

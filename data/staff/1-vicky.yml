  Hello, my name is Laura Castillo and I am the Assistant Supervisor and a
  Registered Early Childhood Educator here at Angelic Treasures Christian Daycare in
  Aurora. I am a wife and mother of two boys. I graduated from Seneca College in 2015
  where I obtained my Diploma of Early Childhood Education. I have over 10 years of
  experience working with children through ages 0-12 and loved every moment. I
  decided to become an educator because I wanted to help shape and form the work
  of tomorrow. I believe that children are our future and its out duty to raise our
  children to lead healthy, successful and independent lives.

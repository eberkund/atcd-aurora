- question: Do we have to be Christian to attend?
  answer: No, we are Christian but you do not have to be. In fact, the families in our centres are from all backgrounds and all religions. We teach Christian values and Bible stories; however, we do not implement services nor sacraments. We teach children about all the values that are rooted in Christianity such as love, forgiveness, honesty, charity, gentleness, kindness and everything else that is wholesome. Parents/Guardians are asked to sign a statement of faith to acknowledge that we will be teaching said curriculum.
- question: Are you licensed by the Ministry of Education?
  answer: Yes, the Ministry checks up on us regularly and we are very proud of our positive and open relationship with them.
- question: Are your staff qualified?
  answer: Yes. All of our extraordinary staff is either certified with a Diploma, Degree or some combination of both. Our staff has their vulnerable sector screening checks done as well as a current Infant/Child CPR and First-Aid certificate.
- question: What meals do you provide?
  answer: We offer morning breakfast, hot lunch, afternoon snacks and fruit at 5 o’clock. We only serve water and milk to drink and we make all necessary dietary accommodations for our children with allergies. The menu is based on the Canada Food Guide and has been created by a nutritionist. It is also approved and recommended by a dietitian. Our chefs have their food handling certificates and amazing palates! Call your closest centre for menu information.
- question: Do you accommodate children with special needs?
  answer: We accept children of all abilities and accommodate all learning needs. We believe in complete inclusion and integration. Please contact us with your child’s differing abilities and we will work with you to make it happen. We also collaborate with regional health teams (OTs, Physio, Doctors, etc.) and we do everything we can to give our special angels the best in service!
- question: How do your centres differ from the rest?
  answer: We offer a Christian curriculum and enrichment programs for children of all ages including French. Our programs are inclusive, targeted and holistic. We foster all areas of development including social, emotional, physical and mental. Our environment focuses on child-led learning and adheres to the pillars of How Does Learning Happen and the ELECT documents. See above to learn more about programs.

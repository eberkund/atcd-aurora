- question: Do we have to be Christian to attend?
  answer: No, we are Christian but you do not have to be. In fact, the families in our centres are from all backgrounds and all religions. We teach Christian values and Bible stories; however, we do not implement services nor sacraments. We teach children about all the values that are rooted in Christianity such as love, forgiveness, honesty, charity, gentleness, kindness and everything else that is wholesome. Parents/Guardians are asked to sign a statement of faith to acknowledge that we will be teaching said curriculum.
- question: Are you licensed by the Ministry of Education? 
  answer: Yes, the Ministry checks up on us regularly and we are very proud of our positive and open relationship with them.
- question: Are your staff qualified? 
  answer: Yes. All of our extraordinary staff is either certified with a Diploma, Degree or some combination of both. Our staff has their vulnerable sector screening checks done as well as a current Infant/Child CPR and First-Aid certificate.

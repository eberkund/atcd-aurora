  bio: >-
    I am a wife and mother of two beautiful children. I graduated from Seneca
    College in 1998 with Honors where I obtained my Diploma of Early Childhood
    Education. I have over 23 years of experience working with children ages 0
    through 12 and loved every moment of it. I decided to become an Early
    Childhood Educator because I wanted to help shape and form the children of
    tomorrow. I believe that children are our future, they require love and
    nurturing to become strong independent individuals.  As the supervisor of
    this center, I am looking forward to working with the staff and families to
    create a welcoming environment for the children.

    I am a graduate of the ECE program at Centennial college. Over the years I
    have had the privilege of working with infants, toddlers, preschoolers and
    school agers.  

    I have many hobbies, one of them includes taking care of my
    little sisters. I have always had a love for children and through that
    interest, I wish to become a kindergarten teacher one day.  I look forward
    to meeting each and everyone of you.

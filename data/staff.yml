    I am a wife and mother of two beautiful children. I graduated from Seneca
    College in 1998 with Honors, where I obtained my Diploma of Early Childhood
    Education. I decided to become an educator because I wanted to help shape
    and form the children of tomorrow. As the supervisor of this center, I look
    forward to working with the staff and families to create a welcoming
    environment for the children.

    I was born and raised in Brazil and I immigrated to Canada in 2017 to study
    at George Brown College. As a parent of three children, I recognize the
    importance and benefits of early education and learning through play.

    I love working with children and being part of their development and
    learning process. Knowing that I can positively impact a child's development
    is an honor. I am so excited to join and work with the Angelic Treasures
    team, children and families.
